#Natural Origin content calculator for cosmetic products

I created this project as tool for calculating "Natural origin content" of cosmetic products according to requirements of ISO 16128.

This tool is useful for all companies to facilitate calculations using database of raw materials and automation of the calculations. Every user can have profile where he can store his calculations and edit them if needed in the future. Also, everyone, if you have profile, will be able to contribute adding raw material in database.

Users will be able to start using the tool no matter if they have profile. Nevertheless, if user don't have profile, they won't be able to store their calculations.

Users wil lbe able to get help using contact form in Contact section or directly email in Contact section.

Project will be maintained and contributed only by the author.

Functionality of the project:

Profile in which to store your information.

Future functionalities:

Direct links of raw material for easier gathering of additional information.
