# Natural Origin content calculator for cosmetic products

I created this project as a tool for calculating "Natural origin content"
of cosmetic products according to requirements of ISO 16128.

This tool is useful for all companies to facilitate calculations using a database of raw materials and automation of the calculations.
Every user can have a profile where they can store their calculations and edit them if needed in the future.
Also, everyone, if you have a profile, will be able to contribute to adding raw material in a database.

Users will be able to start using the tool no matter if they have a profile.
Nevertheless, if a user doesn't have a profile, they won't be able to store their calculations.

Users will be able to get help using a contact form in a Contact section or directly email in a Contact section.

The Project will be maintained and contributed only by the author.
