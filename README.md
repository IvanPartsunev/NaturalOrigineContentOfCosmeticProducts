# Natural Origin content calculator for cosmetic products

I created this project as a tool for calculating "Natural origin content"
of cosmetic products according to requirements of ISO 16128.

This tool is useful for all companies to facilitate calculations using a database of raw materials and automation of the calculations.
Every user can have a profile where they can store their calculations and edit them if needed in the future.
Also, everyone, if you have a profile, will be able to contribute to adding raw material in a database.

Users will be able to start using the tool no matter if they have a profile.
Nevertheless, if a user doesn't have a profile, they won't be able to store their calculations.

Users will be able to get help using a contact form in a Contact section or directly email in a Contact section.

The Project will be maintained and contributed only by the author.

# Functionality of the project:

Free to use a database with all raw materials registered in the site.

Adding new raw materials in a database.
Editing raw materials.

Users are able to create a profile where to calculate natural origin content of products and store them.
Users are able to store the full formulation in the database.
Only the newest one is displayed.

# Future functionalities:

Users will be able
to choose to save only the result for natural origin content of your product or whole formula for further editing.
This option will be given because cosmetic product formulations are intellectual property
and users may not want to store them out of a company database.

User will be able to update existing formulations.

Direct links of raw material for easier gathering of additional information.

Exporting document with calculation results.
